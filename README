This project is now in pre-alpha!

The intent is to create a few python scripts which work together to
manage an AWS cloud to solve suitable tasks.

There will be scripts:
- which work only locally (on a windows workstation)
- which will work remote (i.e. on the started cloud)

The tasks will have a configuration which will permit CloudStarter to
install whatever is needed on the started servers in order to solve the problem.

Further there will be scripts which solve issues like management (in contrast
to worker scripts), again both on workstation and servers.
